# Main Communication Repository

This is the main repository, where the high level communications with Raspberry Pi to Ground Station and low level communications with ARM microprocessors and Raspberry Pi is developed.

The high level communications are developed as TCP/IP communications, where low level communications are developed as USB Serial links.

The hardest part was to achieve a robust communication without crashing the main program in any circumstances.
